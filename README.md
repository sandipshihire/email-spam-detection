# 📧 Email Spam Detection – Machine Learning Web App

A modern, premium-looking Email Spam Detection web application built using
Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The app classifies an email message as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using a
Naive Bayes classifier and provides instant predictions through an
interactive web interface.
